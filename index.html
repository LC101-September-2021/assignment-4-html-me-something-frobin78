         <p>I have dreamed about visiting these places since I was a young child.  I started my list when I was eighteen years old. I have scratched other places off the list because I have visted them, but of course there's more to visit. Sometimes I wish I could go to a beautiful Island and live.</p>

                         <p>Come on and take this short beautiful journey with me!!!!!</p>  
         <h2>Bora Bora, Moorea</h2>

          <p>I only want to visit the bridge because I saw it on a Movie.  I am definitely not a hopeless romantic(haha)!. I think it would be cool to visit.</p>

         <h3>Hawaii, Waikiki</h3>
         <p>I have to say my trip to Hawaii was the best trip ever taken.  The place was very clean and beautiful.  I could not believe how clear and blue the water looked.  You literally could look down to the bottom of the ocean. I felt like I was part of a movie scene.  Now if I can be honest everything was expensive.  Gas prices 20 years ago there was $5.95&cent;/g and a gallon of milk was $4.85&cent;, but I would go back like yesterday.</p>

         <p>After reading a few articles, there are some other destinations I will be adding to the list. Doing online research is a must when deciding to travel. <a href="https://www.usnews.com/info/blogs/press-room/articles/2021-05-18/us-news-reveals-the-2021-22-best-vacations-rankings">This article</a> convinced me to modify my list.  I guess I have to request a few more years on this earth.</p>
